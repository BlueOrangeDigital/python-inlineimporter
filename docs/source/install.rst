Requirements & Installation
###########################

Requirements
============

inline-importer only requires python ``>= 3.4``.

Installation
============

.. warning:: Do not add inline-importer to you project's dependencies! inline-importer is a compile-time development dependency, not a runtime dependency.

Recommended installation of inline-importer is through pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install inline-importer

If you know what you're doing, you can install inline-importer using other methods, but keep in mind that we can't predict if it'll affect usage (it shouldn't, but we don't know).
